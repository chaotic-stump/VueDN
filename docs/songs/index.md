# All Songs

All pages here contain songs (in Swahili) that I settle on and decide to learn their lyrics, periodically.

::: details

`songs` here (the directory and contents) is used as an example of document directory that will be a collection in Decap CMS. The `index.md` files are within directories named in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

Update as needed.

```txt:no-line-numbers
. (Root)

```
