Some text to go here!\

Made on a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor.

> It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log\
> But when I get home to you I find the things that you do\
> Will make me feel alright\
> \
> You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things\
> And it's worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything\
> So why on earth should I moan, cos when I get you alone\
> You know I feel OK\
> \
> When I'm home everything seems to be right\
> When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah\
